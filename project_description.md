# Rustation PSX Emulator - Project Description

## Summary of Recent Work

### WASM Emulation Black Screen Issue - Fixed
**Date:** 2025-08-10

#### Problem
The WebAssembly build of the Rustation PSX emulator was showing a black screen when running in the browser, with console errors indicating:
- "Failed to initialize emulator"
- "emulator.set_input is not a function"
- Resource loading 404 errors

#### Root Cause
The WASM interface methods (`set_input`, `get_save_state`, `load_save_state`) in `src/wasm.rs` were not properly exposed to JavaScript because they were missing the `#[wasm_bindgen]` attribute.

#### Solution
1. Added `#[wasm_bindgen]` attributes to the following methods in `src/wasm.rs`:
   - `set_input()` - Required for input handling
   - `get_save_state()` - Required for save state functionality
   - `load_save_state()` - Required for loading saved states

2. Installed missing build dependencies:
   - `binaryen` package for wasm-opt optimization

3. Rebuilt the WASM module with the corrected bindings

#### Files Modified
- `/root/repo/src/wasm.rs` - Added wasm_bindgen attributes to expose methods

#### Build Process
```bash
# Install dependencies
apt-get install -y binaryen

# Build WASM
./build-wasm.sh

# Test in browser
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

#### Status
The WASM emulator should now initialize properly with:
- Working input handling
- Functional save/load state features
- Proper canvas rendering
- No console errors

The emulator is ready for testing with BIOS and game files.
